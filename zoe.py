    "linear regression": "Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line. It's often used to predict outcomes based on trends in data. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression",
    "logistic regression": "Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical (like yes/no, 0/1). It estimates probabilities using a logistic (sigmoid) function and is widely used for binary classification. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression",
    "overfitting": "Overfitting happens when a model learns noise in the training data instead of the actual pattern. It performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting",
    "underfitting": "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfitting",
    "precision recall": "Precision is the ratio of true positives to total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives. Precision is about exactness, and recall is about completeness. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"
